# Vehicle-Fleet-Optimization

- Capstone analytics project for a Environment and waste management company on its trip level transaction data and GPS vehicle tracking data.

- The objective here is to predict the service times required for a customer given the driver, vehicle and waste type, which helped the company to optimise the number of customers served in a given day by its fleet, adding significant business value.
